# Software configuration

Using the Drotek RTK modules with the Pixhawk 3 PRO autopilot requires very little configuration, as the autopilot takes care of most of the configuring process. Connecting your autopilot to the _Mission Planner_ or _QGroundControl_ software will allow you to tweak the parameters necessary to the well being of the RTK setup. You can follow the steps in the Rover and Base sections to find out more on the configuration process for the two modules.

Using QGroundControl or Mission Planner, you can check if the RTCM messages are present in the MAVLink. If they are present, then the corrections will automatically be forwarded to the rover module, which means your RTK setup is all right.
