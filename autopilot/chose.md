#Choosing a RTK module with the Pixhawk 3 PRO

Depending on your needs, you might choose a different module to use with your Pixhawk 3 PRO. 

For a space constrained application, the **Tiny RTK module** would be the best choice, as it is affordable, modulable with the possibility to choose the antenna, and the smallest RTK module existing. The XL RTK or Sirius RTK modules can also suit a space constrained setup with their **smart form-factor** and **built-in antenna** that will relieve the need of an external antenna to set up onto your vehicle. 

The three RTK modules will offer a user-friendly installation as they are all three plug-&-play built specifically for the Pixhawk 3 PRO autopilot.
