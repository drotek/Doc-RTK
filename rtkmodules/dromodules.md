# Drotek's RTK modules

Drotek sells four different RTK modules that each have their own characteristics. Depending on the use-case and the general context of application, different modules should be picked in order to achieve the most efficient build.

### Module Tiny RTK

The Tiny RTK module is the smallest RTK module available. Able to act as a base or rover, this lightweight module (approx. 5 gramms) is plug-&-play and will only require the user to plug an antenna to it, and a telemetry system to allow it to communicate with the second module. An External Interuption pin is available so users can use the module very efficiently in order to have accurate timestamping. It's USB connector will allow you to configure it easily through the U-Center software.

#### Input / Outputs

The Tiny RTK module features:

* 1 MicroUSB connector
* 2 JST-GH connectors
* 1 SMA Antenna connector
* 1 EXTINT interrupt input pin


### Module XL RTK

The XL RTK module, with its built-in antenna patch, is able to act as a rover or base, even though the base mode is not recommended because of the size of the antenna patch. You can select the role of your module very easily with a switch built onto the board. Plug-&-play, this module only requires the user to plug the telemetry equipment in order to be used. It's USB connector will allow you to configure it easily through the U-Center software. Also, the integrated compass will offer your vehicle a more accurate positioning and make your heading sensing more efficient (with the module being used as rover on your vehicle).
