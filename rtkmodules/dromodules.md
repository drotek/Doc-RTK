# Drotek's RTK modules

Drotek sells four different RTK modules that each have their own characteristics. Depending on the use-case and the general context of application, different modules should be picked in order to achieve the most efficient build.

</p>

The Tiny RTK module is the smallest RTK module available. Able to act as a base or rover, this lightweight module (approx. 5 gramms) is plug-&-play and will only require the user to plug an antenna to it, and a telemetry system to allow it to communicate with the second module. An External Interuption pin is available so users can use the module very efficiently in order to have accurate timestamping. It's USB connector will allow you to configure it easily through the U-Center software.

#### _Input / Outputs_

The Tiny RTK module features:

* 1 MicroUSB connector
* 2 JST-GH 6 pin connectors
* 1 SMA Antenna connector
* 1 EXTINT interrupt input pin



### Module XL RTK

The XL RTK module, with its built-in (passive) antenna patch, is able to act as a rover or base, even though the base mode is not recommended because of the size of the antenna patch. You can select the role of your module very easily with a switch built onto the board. Plug-&-play, this module only requires the user to plug the telemetry equipment in order to be used. It's USB connector will allow you to configure it easily through the U-Center software. Also, the integrated compass will offer your vehicle a more accurate positioning and make your heading sensing more efficient (with the module being used as rover on your vehicle). The board has 7 through-hole connectors where you can solder pin header, which make the module very modular.

#### _Input / Outputs_

The XL RTK module features:

* 1 MicroUSB connector
* 2 JST-GH 6 pins connectors
* 7 through-hole connectors



### Module XXL RTK

The XXL RTK module is made to provide the most reliable base module possible. Featuring a Tallysman TW3742 active antenna, it is the best module to provide your system with an accurate and powerful base module. It has integrated rechargable batteries so it can be used as stand alone module without an external power supply, and a built-in jack connector to recharge these batteries. Meant to be used as a base module, it can be easily put onto a tripod in order to raise it up, have a stable base and allow clean transportation on the field.

#### _Input / Outputs_

The XXL RTK module features:

* 1 MicroUSB connector
* 1 JST-GH 6 pin connector
* 1 Jack connector
