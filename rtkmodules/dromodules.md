</p>

The XL RTK GNSS is the smallest Multi-band RTK module available. Able to act as a base or rover, this **lightweight** module (approx. 18 grams) is plug-&-play and will only require the user to plug an antenna to it, and a telemetry system to allow it to communicate with the second module _(optional)_. It's USB connector will allow you to configure it easily through the U-Center software.

#### _Input / Outputs_

The XL RTK GNSS module features:

* 1 MicroUSB connector
* 3 JST-GH 6 pin connectors
* 1 SMA Antenna connector
* 2 UART + 1 SPI + 1 I2C

</p>

The Tiny RTK GNSS is the smallest RTK module available. Able to act as a base or rover, this **lightweight** module (approx. 5 grams) is plug-&-play and will only require the user to plug an antenna to it, and a telemetry system to allow it to communicate with the second module _(optional)_. An External Interruption pin is available so users can use the module very efficiently in order to have accurate **timestamping**. It's USB connector will allow you to configure it easily through the U-Center software.

#### _Input / Outputs_

The Tiny RTK GNSS features:

* 1 MicroUSB connector
* 2 JST-GH 6 pin connectors
* 1 SMA Antenna connector
* 1 EXTINT interrupt input pin

  <img src="./images/xl3D.png?raw=true" alt="XL RTK 3D"/>
</p>


The XL RTK module, with its **built-in** (passive) **antenna patch**, is able to act as a rover or base, even though the base mode is not recommended because of the size of the antenna patch. You can select the role of your module very easily with a switch built onto the board. Plug-&-play, this module only requires the user to plug the telemetry equipment in order to be used. It's USB connector will allow you to configure it easily through the U-Center software. Also, the **integrated compass** will offer your vehicle a more accurate positioning and make your heading sensing more efficient (with the module being used as rover on your vehicle). It's **I2C port** will also allow you to add various I2C compatible devices to your system. The board has 7 through-hole connectors where you can solder pin header, which make the module very modular.

#### _Input / Outputs_

The XL RTK GNSS features:

* 1 MicroUSB connector
* 2 JST-GH 6 pins connectors
* 7 through-hole connectors

</p>

The XXL RTK module is made to provide the most reliable base module possible. Featuring a **Tallysman TW3742 active antenna**, it is the best module to provide your system with an accurate and powerful base module. It has integrated **rechargeable batteries** so it can be used as stand alone module without an external power supply, and a built-in jack connector to recharge these batteries. Meant to be used as a base module, it can be easily put onto a **tripod** thanks to it's **threaded hole** underneath the case, in order to raise it up, have a stable base and allow clean transportation on the field.

#### _Input / Outputs_

The XXL RTK GNSS features:

* 1 MicroUSB connector
* 1 JST-GH 6 pin connector
* 1 Jack connector
* 1 active [Tallysman TW3740](http://www.tallysman.com/index.php/gnss/products/antennas-gpsbeidougalileoglonass/tw3740-tw3742/) antenna

### Sirius RTK GNSS Rover (M8P)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/sirius3D.png?raw=true" alt="Sirius 3D"/>
</p>

The Sirius RTK module is built to provide a reliable rover module for your vehicle. With a built-in **active antenna patch**, it is capable of interacting with the Galileo satellites network, along with the common GPS, Beidou and Glonass networks, which will provide more accuracy for it's positioning. The form factor of the Sirius module is simple, thus easily fitting most setup designs as well as easy to integrate into your vehicle. It's 6 pin JST-GH connector makes it plug-and-play with the Pixhawk PRO 3 autopilot.

**The unicity of this connector makes it impossible for this module to be used as a base module.**

#### _Input / Outputs_

The Sirius RTK GNSS features: 

* 1 JST-GH 6 pins connector
* 1 active antenna
