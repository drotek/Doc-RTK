_Important Note : **All** Drotek modules are built with the M8P-2 Ublox chip. This means that all the Drotek modules are capable to act as rover or base. This is true, whatever the connectivity or the size of antenna that's used. You will see in this book what makes one module more suitable for one application than another, but remember that all modules can act as rover or base. Only the environment and the user's specific use-case will determine which module suits his needs best._
