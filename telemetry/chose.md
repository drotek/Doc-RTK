</p>

Drotek's 433/915 MHz Telemetry kit can very easily be used with Drotek's RTK modules. Already configured in factory, it is **plug-&-play** with the RTK modules and will offer **more than a kilometer** of range for your system (using the right antennas). Available in both **433 MHz** or **915 MHz**, it can output 100 mW, and it's range can be upgraded by using a bi-directional amplifier or installing omni-antennas.
