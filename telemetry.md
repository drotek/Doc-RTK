#The telemetry link

The role of the telemetry link is to allow communication between the rover and base module. In the case you encapsulate the RTK data into the MAVLink, the telemetry link providing communication between rover and base modules is the telemetry link between your base control station (usually a computer) and your autopilot. In other cases, you may need to use an external telemetry kit to link your rover and base module.

It is possible to use many systems for this role, but in this book, I will only introduce you to Drotek's telemetry kit and to the WiFi possibility as they are the most commonly used.
