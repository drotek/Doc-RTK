##Chosing your base module!

To ensure that you have an efficient flying vehicle, you'll need to pick the most adapted rover module in order to save energy, and thus flight time (or autonomy for terrestrial vehicles).

The different modules available from Drotek are all capable of acting as a rover, but integrating a rover module on your machine requires to take care of the **space constraint**, the **weight** of the module and it's parts, as well as the **power consumption** which will be impacted by the module you pick.

Even though the chip featured on all of Drotek's RTK modules is the same, the **XL RTK** and **Tiny RTK** modules were designed in order to be the best option for someone looking for an efficient rover module.

The **XL RTK** module is the most effective choice for an application with an important **space-constraint**, a **limited power supply**, and that requires a **lightweight** module to fit the vehicle. It's built-in passive antenna patch will prevent the user from having to buy and install an external antenna, as well as **reducing** the **machine's weight** (compared to external antennas) to allow flight over a longer period of time. The well-thought design of the board also offers a very limited consumption in order to save energy, and the through-holes of the PCB will allow the user to install it very easily on any machine.
