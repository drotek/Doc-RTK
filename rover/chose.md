##Chosing your rover module!

To ensure that you have an efficient flying vehicle, you'll need to pick the most adapted rover module in order to save energy, and thus flight time (or autonomy for terrestrial vehicles).

The different modules available from Drotek are all capable of acting as a rover, but integrating a rover module on your machine requires to take care of the **space constraint**, the **weight** of the module and it's parts, as well as the **power consumption** which will be impacted by the module you pick.

Even though the chip featured on all of Drotek's RTK modules is the same, the **Sirius** and **XL RTK** modules were designed in order to be the best option for someone looking for an efficient rover module.

###_Overview_

####Sirius RTK

</p>

Built to perform specifically with the **Pixhawk 3 PRO** autopilot, the **Sirius RTK** module offers the best performances for an **accurate** and **plug-and-play** experience. It's compact form-factor makes it **easy to install** on any machine, and it's single cable, delivering power, serial link and I2C bus connectivity, will **free a lot of space** for any additional device or sensor you need on your machine and allow a **clean setup**. The active [**GBA-154 C**](http://www.cirocomm.com/category-Embeded-Active-2-2.html) antenna located inside the case and the reliability of the Ublox M8P chip can offer incredible performances, and the **magnetometer** present on the board, _Honeywell_'s [HMC5983](https://aerocontent.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/Defense_Brochures-documents/HMC5983_3_Axis_Compass_IC.pdf) or _ST_'s [LIS3MDL](http://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lis3mdl.html), will provide **one more sensor** to have the safest vehicle possible.

####XL RTK

</p>

The **XL RTK** module is the most effective choice for an application with an important **space-constraint**, a **limited power supply**, and that requires a **lightweight** module to fit the vehicle. It's built-in passive antenna patch will prevent the user from having to buy and install an external antenna, as well as **reducing** the **machine's weight** (compared to external antennas) to allow flight over a longer period of time. The well-thought design of the board also offers a very limited consumption in order to save energy, and the through-holes of the PCB will allow the user to install it very easily on any machine. It's **built-in compass** will also provide one more heading sensor for your machine to be as reliable as possible.

####Tiny RTK

</p>

Allowing the user to use it with an antenna of his choice, the **Tiny RTK** module is modular and can also suit an application with important space-constraint as it is the **smallest module available** (antenna excluded). Depending on the antenna that's chosen, the Tiny RTK module will be best if you can afford to **add weight** to your machine in order to gain access to centimetric accuracy. It is possible to buy it with or without a **case** that will protect the board in case of extreme working conditions, as well as preventing direct contact with the board (reducing static electricity shocks risks).

####XXL RTK

</p>

The **XXL RTK** module should only be used for vehicles that can afford to gain a larger amount of weight than the other modules. It's built-in batteries and large antenna make up for a serious weight gain, and the large case and form-factor of the antenna make it hard to install on a small or lightweight machine.
