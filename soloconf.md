#3DR Solo RTK Module Configuration

In order to enable RTK use with your 3DR Solo drone, you will need to install it into your drone. You will have to remove the top cover of the drone and replace the original GNSS board with the Drotek module. Also, you will need update your drone's Firmware in order to allow it to work with RTK, and finally use Mission Planner or QGroundControl to inject RTK differential data into the SoloLink.
