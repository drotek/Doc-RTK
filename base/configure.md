#Configuration of the Base!

In order to configure the base, you need: 
* 1 Computer
* 1 Micro USB cable
* **Latest** version of UCenter Software (available [here](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center-windows))
* **Latest** version of Mission Planner Software (available [here](http://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/common-install-mission-planner.html))

###Configuring the Ublox chip

First of all, install the UCenter software on your computer, as well as the Mission Planner software that you will need later on. When done, you can connect your base module to your computer. Open the UCenter software after that, and connect it to your base module using the button in the upper-left corner.
