# The Base

The main purpose of the base is to provide a known position to the RTK system in order for the RTKLib to compute the exact position of the rover module. It is then necessary to have a base whose position doesn't vary in time, and with the most accurate self-positioning ability, as the more accurate is the positioning of the base, the more accurate will be the positioning of the rover module.
