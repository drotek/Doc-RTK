Chosing the right base module is the first step in order to build an RTK setup that is truly efficient.

The role of the base is as important as the rover's, as the two modules will communicate informations on their position, and having an **accurate positioning for your base will provide best results** for the computing of the position of the rover module.

Even though the chip featured on all of Drotek's RTK modules is the same, the **XXL RTK** module is **designed specifically** for the base role and can't be beaten in this application.

The key features for the base application of the XXL RTK module are it's [Tallysman TW3740](http://www.tallysman.com/index.php/gnss/products/antennas-gpsbeidougalileoglonass/tw3740-tw3742/) **active** antenna, a pair of **rechargeable batteries** included in the case that allow the module to be autonomous and **independant of external power sources**, and a **screw hole** underneath the case to allow it's user to mount it on a tripod and make sure the module is stable and not moving.
